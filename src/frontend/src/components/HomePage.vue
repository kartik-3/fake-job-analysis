      Welcome to <strong>Job Verify!</strong> <br><br>
      This tool assists users in classifying the authenticity of a job posting. It prevents them from being scammed by
      fake
      job poster agencies and saves them from sharing sensitive information to illegitimate parties.<br><br>
      To use the tool, go to the 'Predict' page from the sidebar and enter the relevant details to get a prediction on
      whether this is a real or a fake job.<br><br>
      You can also see some graphs in the visualizations tab. To go the tab, go to the 'Visualizations' page from the
      sidebar. The graphs are interactive so feel free to hover and click on elements.
